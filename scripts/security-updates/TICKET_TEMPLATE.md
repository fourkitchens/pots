Hello!

Security updates are required for some of the code that runs your website, [SITE_NAME].

We''ll run the upgrade and the work will be billed to your flat-rate annual/monthly security updates account.
In other words, this will not count towards your subscription hours.

Security updates are required for: [PROJECTS]

These updates are being performed automatically, and we'll let you know when it is complete.
Thank You!
